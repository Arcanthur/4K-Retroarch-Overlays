===================================

The overlays that have a rounded border are intended for non integer scaling, 4:3 aspect ratio, using CRT_Geom shader with these settings changed and the screens are curved exactly where they need to be:

CRT Geom Curvature Radius: 3.00
CRT Corner Size: 0.00
CRT Geom Sharpness: 3.00

The overlays that go all the way around the screen are intended for integer scaling.
